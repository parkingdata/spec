        Lists `AssignedRights` and allows searching/filtering by:

        * one or more `HolderCredentials` and `RightSpecifications`, to check if given credentials have any of the given rights to park
        * latitude, longitude, radius: to check for `AssignedRights` within a geographic area
        * a list of `Places`, to retrieve all assigned rights within a set of parking locations
        * start_before: to get sessions starting before a given instant
        * end_before: to get sessions ending before a given instant
        * start_after: to get sessions starting after a given instant
        * end_after: to get sessions ending after a given instant
        * a modification instant: to only display changed resources from that point onwards

        Additionally, supports providing a comma-separated list of optional object attributes associated to an `AssignedRight` that should be included in the result set. If unused or left blank, `none` will be assumed.

        Lists `RateTables` and allows searching/filtering by:

        * latitude, longitude, radius: to check for `AssignedRights` within a geographic area
        * a list of `Places`, to retrieve all rates connected to `AssignedRights` that belong to any of the given places
        * a list of `RightSpecifications`, to retrieve all the connected 
        * a modification instant: to only display changed resources from that point onwards

        Additionally, supports providing a comma-separated list of optional object attributes associated to a `RateTable` that should be included in the result set. If unused or left blank, `none` will be assumed.

        Lists `Observations` and allows searching/filtering by:

        * latitude, longitude, radius: to check for `Observations` within a geographic area
        * a list of `Places`, to retrieve all Observations within a set of parking locations
        * start_before: to get observations starting before a given instant
        * end_before: to get observations ending before a given instant
        * start_after: to get observations starting after a given instant
        * end_after: to get observations ending after a given instant
        * a modification instant: to only display changed resources from that point onwards

        Additionally, supports providing a comma-separated list of optional object attributes associated to an `Observation` that should be included in the result set. If unused or left blank, `none` will be assumed.
